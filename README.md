# Region Normalization for Image Inpainting

The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10375).

The codes are initial version, not the revised version. I will update these someday since I am busy currently. However, if you have any question about the paper/codes, you can contact me through Email(yutao666@mail.ustc.edu.cn).

Please run the codes where the python is Version 3.x and pytorch>=0.4.

## Preparation
Before running the codes, you should prepare training/evaluation image file list (flist) and mask file list (flist). You can refer to the folowing command to generate .flist file:
```
python flist.py --path your_dataset_folder --output xxx.flist
```

## Training
There are some hyperparameters that you can adjust in the main.py. To train the model, you can run:
```
python main.py --bs 14 --gpus 2 --prefix rn --img_flist your_training_images.flist --mask_flist your_training_masks.flist
```
PS: You can set the "--bs" and "--gpus" to any number as you like. The above is just an example.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model, you can use GPU or CPU to run.

For GPU:
```
python eval.py --bs your_batch_size --model your_checkpoint_path --img_flist your_eval_images.flist --mask_flist your_eval_masks.flist
```

For CPU:
```
python eval.py --cpu --bs your_batch_size --model your_checkpoint_path --img_flist your_eval_images.flist --mask_flist your_eval_masks.flist
```

PS: The pretrained model under folder './pretrained_model/' is trained from Places2 dataset with [Irregular Mask](https://nv-adlr.github.io/publication/partialconv-inpainting) dataset. **Please train RN from scratch if you test data not from Places2 or using regular mask.**
